### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Johnny, I'm 22 years old, and I consider myself a
creative and responsible person. I've been focusing my practices
and studies on UI/UX technologies. Through my university
projects, I worked with Start Americas Together to develop a
web application to enhance the management of the activities
for their volunteers using React, also I was part of the
development of an ERP Web app for Estrutec SRL using PERN
tech stack, which is still working. Finally, I was an intern full
stack developer on Truextend. I wish to continue my software
development career in a serious company and start creating
software that adds value to our society.
